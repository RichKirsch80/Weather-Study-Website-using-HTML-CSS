# Web-Design-Challenge

Created a visualization dashboard website using visualizations of plotting of weather data.
In building this dashboard, I've created individual pages for each plot and a means by which we can navigate between them. 
These pages contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. 

The website must consist of 7 pages total, including:

A landing page containing: 
An explanation of the project.Links to each visualizations page. 
A sidebar containing preview images of each plot, and clicking an image that will take the user to that visualization.


Four visualization pages, each with:
The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.


A "Comparisons" page that:
Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so you can easily visually compare them.

A "Data" page that:
Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.

File: App.py
python file to convert the cities.csv file into the table used for Data page.

File: table.html
output of app.py with html code to create table for Data page.
